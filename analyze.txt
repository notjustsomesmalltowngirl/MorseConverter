Write down how you approached the project. I looked up morse code mappings and had GPT generate me a dictionary mapping.
What was hard, what was easy.  Nothing was hard really it was easy.
How might you improve for the next project?
What was your biggest learning from today?  I learned to anticipate problems like KeyErrors and stuffs before they happened.
What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?
